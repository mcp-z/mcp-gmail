## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- Works with `@mcp-z/oauth-google` 2.0.1, which replaced `toAuth()` with a token provider. Version 2.0.0 of this package resolves that release through its `^2.0.0` range and fails at runtime on any Google API call. Upgrade.

- The 1.x line is maintained on `support/1.x` and published under the `support-1` dist-tag.
